# Intro

This repository is documentation about how we do things in the kalispera organisation.

# What

* We [manage our projects with HYPE](https://github.com/kalispera/HYPE)
* We [commit conventionally](https://conventionalcommits.org/)
* We [release semantically](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release)
* We [let circleCi do the monkey stuff](https://circleci.com/)
* We [license with MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
* We [format our code prettier](https://prettier.io/)
* We [let greenkeeper remind us about dependencies](https://greenkeeper.io/)
* We [sync our labels and milestones across repositories](https://github.com/Xiphe/github-sync-labels-milestones)
* We [treat us and others nicely](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/)
* We [believe in love and peace](https://github.com/love-and-peace/love-and-peace/blob/master/versions/karma/v1.0-karma1/en.md)

# Why

We like to keep things transparent. Also we like to point at things so when someone asks us, how we work this is the place we point to. If you have questions about why or even noticed something we
could do better, please don't [hesitate to let us know](https://github.com/kalispera/how-we-work/issues/new).
